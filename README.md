# clearbank-cat-challenge

This is my submission for ClearBank's Technical Test

Basic premise of the cat app is a mini tournament of cat images where the user can compare 4 images and choose which is their favourite of them.

The User will choose one image from round 1 and 2 by clicking on them. This will remove the other image

When two images are chosen, they are then moved to another bracket for the 'final' and a winning image is chosen.

The winning image will be rendered by itself, the user can then choose to save the image using the API endpoint to save the cat image to the account ID I used to set up the CAT api. The User can then press the reset button to see 4 more new images.

The user can navigate to the saved cats page to see evey cat that has been saved.
